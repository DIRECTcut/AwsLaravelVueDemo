# AWS Laravel Vue Document Management System

## Project Overview
This is a multi-service document management system showcasing senior-level development skills through AWS integration with Laravel and Vue 3. The project demonstrates SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and enterprise-grade architecture patterns.

## Core Features
- Document upload, storage, and management via S3
- OCR and document analysis using AWS Textract
- Sentiment analysis and entity extraction via AWS Comprehend
- Asynchronous processing workflows with SQS/SNS
- CDN delivery through CloudFront
- Real-time processing status updates
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- User access control and document sharing

## Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service class handles one AWS service
- **Open/Closed**: Strategy pattern for extensible document processors
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interface-based AWS service abstractions
- **Interface Segregation**: Granular contracts for different operations
- **Dependency Inversion**: Repository pattern with dependency injection

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern**: Document processing strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven file processing
- **Command Pattern**: Batch operations and queued jobs
- **Factory Pattern**: AWS service client creation
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhanced document metadata

## AWS Services Integration

### Primary Services
- **S3**: Document storage with intelligent tiering and lifecycle policies
- **Textract**: OCR, form data extraction, and document analysis
- **Comprehend**: Natural language processing and sentiment analysis
- **SQS**: Reliable message queuing for async operations
- **SNS**: Event notifications and system alerts
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery network

### Supporting Services
- **IAM**: Fine-grained access control
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **Lambda**: Serverless processing functions (if needed)

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 12
- Laravel Fortify (Authentication)
- Pest (Testing Framework)
- AWS SDK for PHP

### Frontend
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript
- Inertia.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Reka UI Components

### Development Tools
- Pest for TDD
- Laravel Pint (Code formatting)
- ESLint + Prettier (Frontend linting)
- Concurrently (Development workflow)

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimum code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining tests

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Service classes, repositories, and utilities
- **Feature Tests**: HTTP endpoints and user workflows
- **Integration Tests**: AWS service interactions (with mocking)
- **Browser Tests**: End-to-end user scenarios

### Mock Strategy
- AWS services mocked in tests using Mockery
- Real AWS integration tests in separate test suite
- Fake S3 storage for local development

## Development Commands

### Backend
```bash
# Run tests
composer test

# Code formatting
composer pint

# Start development server
composer dev
```

### Frontend
```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Linting
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required AWS Environment Variables
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=your-cloudfront-domain
AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=your-sqs-queue-url
AWS_SNS_TOPIC_ARN=your-sns-topic-arn
```

### Local Development Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure database settings
3. Add AWS credentials
4. Run `php artisan key:generate`
5. Run `php artisan migrate`
6. Start development: `composer dev`

## Code Quality Standards

### PHP Standards
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Type declarations for all methods
- Comprehensive DocBlocks
- Exception handling with custom exceptions
- Resource management (try-finally blocks for AWS calls)

### Vue/TypeScript Standards
- Composition API with TypeScript
- Props and emits type definitions
- Composables for shared logic
- Error boundary components

## Security Considerations
- AWS IAM roles with least privilege access
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload security (MIME type validation)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for S3 uploads
- Signed URLs for secure file access

## Performance Optimization
- S3 multipart uploads for large files
- CloudFront caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Vue component lazy loading
- Image optimization and thumbnails

## Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch integration for AWS services
- Laravel logging for application events
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection

## Deployment Strategy
- Environment-based configuration
- Database migrations and rollbacks
- Asset compilation and optimization
- AWS resource provisioning scripts
- Health checks and monitoring setup
